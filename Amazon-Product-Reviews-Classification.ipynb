              "['\\nThis device is sleek and compact, making it perfect for any room in the house. The sound quality is impressive for its size and the addition of the virtual assistant, Alexa, makes it incredibly easy to use.One of the standout features of the Echo Dot is its ability to control smart home devices. With the simple command of \"Alexa, turn off the lights,\" I can easily control all of my connected devices without even having to get up. This feature alone has been a game changer for me and has made my daily routine much more efficient.Another great feature is the ability to play music from a variety of sources. Whether I want to listen to my favorite playlist on Spotify or catch up on the latest news, the Echo Dot has me covered. The device also integrates seamlessly with other Echo devices, allowing me to fill my entire home with sound.Overall, I highly recommend the Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) to anyone looking to add a versatile and convenient smart device to their home. It has exceeded my expectations and has quickly become an essential part of my daily routine.\\n',\n",
              " \"\\nOverall I liked the echo dot and I ordered another one. But shortly after I got that new one, the old one stopped working. It was working fine, no one disturbed it, and then I looked up and saw that it had a solid blue light on. I tried to use it and it wouldn't respond as if it didn't hear me. I unplugged it, plugged it back in, and it spun around and turned solid blue again. I looked online and saw that to reset it I had to press one of the buttons down for about 30 seconds. I did that, but nothing changed. I could not get it to have an orange light signifying that it was ready to set up again. I tried disconnecting it from my account, and that didn't fix it either. I saw someone online say that it happened to them and it couldn't be fixed. I contacted support and was given something to make up for it. I just wanted it to work or to be able to fix it.I am now concerned that these may have a short life and might not be able to be fixed in the future. Maybe it's simply this version of the dots. Either way, I would only expect to get about a year out of them and be happy if it lasts longer. I guess a year is fine for the price since I got it on sale.\\n\",\n",

              " '\\nThis was my second echo unit for me. I needed something to extend the range of my Echo Show to other rooms. Plus, I wanted something I could use as a speaker for my music.The sound quality is awesome on this. I can crank it up to the max setting and I\\'m not hearing any type of distortion in the sound.It seems to \"hear\" me even when my other echo units don\\'t. I have two of the sphere ones that I bought for the same reason that I got this unit, and they don\\'t always hear me, even when I\\'m right there on top of them. But this unit ALWAYS hears me and completes the command for me. I don\\'t know if there is a problem with the Echo Show and the two sphere units, but this one never fails.I\\'d recommend getting this unit to anyone who is looking for one. This one went on a deal and that\\'s when I picked it up. Figured at the price I got it at, it wouldn\\'t be a loss if it wasn\\'t a great performer, but I ended up pleasantly surprised. I\\'ve had it for about 2 years and it\\'s working just as well as it did when I got it.\\n',\n",

I've been wanting to get this for a while, but always put it off to get something else I needed more and I had a speaker I hooked up to my phone when I wanted to listen to my music on spotify. Well, this is very convenient I'm cleaning/cooking, whatever I can just yell at Alexa to turn on my music...lol. It's also wonderful when I want to listen to sleep sounds at night when going to bed. The only thing that is annoying is you kinda have to be specific with Alexa or she just doesn't know...LOL otherwise she is GREAT! I have two, one in my bedroom and one in the living room, gotta get one more for the kitchen.\\n\",\n",
              " \"\\nLoved my 9, yes, 9, echo dots (not including those bought as gifts for friends), until Amazon changed how they play music choices.  I was ecstatic that I could play synchronized music throughout my house, but as of November 2022, the entire echo experience has been totally trashed.  I can no longer play music of my choice.  The other Alexa features are nice, i.e.:  setting timers, reminders, controlling lights, etc., but for me and every one of my friends, the primary benefit was playing synchronized music of choice throughout the house on pretty decent speakers at a reasonable cost.  Now, rather than being able to request a specific song, artist, or album, all requests are, as Alexa says, 'shuffling' your request plus 'others in a similar genre', with a limited number of skips allowed.I've been a Prime Member almost since its inception, and have been more than positive in my reviews of Amazon products and services, but I can think of nothing positive to say about this change.  It was obviously done with the intention of forcing people to subscribe to Amazon Music; even the supposed great new benefit offered to Prime Customers of being able to create your own playlists is horrifically adulterated by 'shuffling' the songs in the customer's playlist with songs 'of a similar genre'. I thought, yay, I'll try that, and set up a playlist of 18 songs to try it out.  Alexa played 3 of my songs, then interjected a song by an artist I have never requested.  I thought, ok, I can deal with an occasional non-requested song/artist.  Alexa then played another song from my playlist, but after that played nothing that I would EVER listen to by choice.  After approximately 5 or 6 of these and never returning to a single song from my playlist, I said 'sc#@w' this and told her to stop.  What a terrible loss.Amazon:  as big a fan as I have always been of your services and products, I will NEVER be forced to join an Amazon Music monthly subscription, specifically because of efforts to bully me into doing so.  I just lost an incredible amount of respect for Amazon.\\n\",\n",
              " \"\\nThis is a great product for its size and price!  I love the fact that I don't have to touch anything; I can just speak to Alexa and she'll do the rest. Sometimes, it can be irritating when Alexa doesn't understand or do what you ask right away or she'll play the wrong song or artist that I requested.  But it's a great product to have; especially when cooking in the kitchen. You can ask Alexa for any recipes or have her announce things to all devices to alert or notify your family that's in separate rooms! I really like that!  Overall, it's a great product to have!  I have 5 in my house!!!! It works great with the sengled light bulbs where you can connect it with echo speaker device and ask Alexa to turn off/on the lights.!\\n\",\n",
              " '\\nYa he comprado 3 unidades de Echo dot 3rd gen y 1 Echo dot 5th gen y me encanta la 3rd gen porque es super compacta, bonita y suena muy bien.El foco si costo demasiado conectarla tanto de G by E y de Philips, pero cuando se logran conectar funcionan muy bien.I have bought 3 units of Echo dot 3 and 1 of echo dot 5th and a I love my echo 3, because its very portable, pretty and sounds very good.\\n',\n",
              " '\\nIt seems people either love or hate Alexa. I like mine, but I don\\'t love it. My wife is from another country--English is her 3rd or 4th language--she and Alexa do not always get along, so I end up repeating my wife\\'s requests, which works most of the time. I\\'ve learned a few things, though. Never aske to play the same song more than once per week. When Alexa\\'s AI figures out that you really like a song, it always goes to the $3.99 extra per month list of songs. It seems safe to ask for a specific group, i.e., the Rolling Stones or the Beatles, just don\\'t ask for specific songs too often. My wife and I both love a wide variety of music, but my wife tends to get frustrated by Alexa and does not use the unit very often.I liked my generation 2 so well that I bought one each for a couple of family members and another one for myself (it is a generation 3). I was going to buy a third unit for my in-home office, but after transferring the 2nd gen from my bedroom for my office, I realized I could not concentrate on my work for listening to the music.I\\'ve heard all the stories about how Alexa is spying on me, but I\\'m not terribly concerned. I watch a fair number of YouTube videos--anything that sparks my interest--and the 3rd gen unit is right next to the TV, so, if it\\'s recording my info, it\\'s getting a wide variety from sensible to weird information. Also, I like to play the TV while I\\'m away from home, just to confuse the would-be burglars, and I usually play it on one of the traditional news channels, because they talk a lot instead of showing movies, and that should confuse the wannabe burglars more. I tried using Alexa for that, but the unit stops playing after half a dozen songs (just estimating), but the TV will drone on and on until I turn it off. When some of my more suspicious friends or relatives visit, I unplug the unit so they can talk candidly, just to make them feel more comfortable. I have been known to remind them that their cell phones and TV sets do the same thing, even when you turn them off.I\\'ve learned to be very specific about the music I want to hear. I never tell Alexa to play a song without specifying the artist. If she still picks the wrong song or artist, I try to ask in a different way, but usually find out that the song I want to hear is on the $3.99 per month additional list, which I do not subscribe to. The unit is usually pretty good about substituting a channel that has music I like--based on the song I asked for. I\\'m impressed that AI is as smart as it is in this tiny unit.Sometimes, when I get bored, I like to ask Alexa stupid or confusing questions, just to see how it answers. Yeah, I\\'m easily entertained, but it\\'s surprising what the unit can come up with. I get a lot of \"Sorry, I don\\'t know that.\"My brother and I were trying to fix a leaky faucet in my daughter\\'s home when her Alexa unit in the other room spoke to us. At first we thought someone had come in without our knowing it. Since it was a female voice, we did not start looking for weapons to defend ourselves from burglars, but we quickly went to see who was there. The house was empty. I laughed when my brother suggested the house might be haunted, but it made me stop and think. Later, my daughter reminded me about the Alexa unit I had bought for her--yep, same voice. The point is, you never know what will set the unit off. You do not have to mention its name or speak to it.I\\'ve never had a problem with the unit waking me up in the middle of the night, but it does start blinking yellow when I have a notification. Took me a while to figure that out. I get notified about storms, kidnappings in my home state, when an Amazon package has arrived, and a few other miscellaneous messages. It never wakes me up, except for when I set an alarm, but I have to set the alarms individually. I cannot tell it to wake me up every weekday morning at 7 a.m. I have to set a separate alarm for every morning of every day I want awakened. But it also allows me to set other alarms. For instance, I can tell it to set an alarm for 5 p.m., so I don\\'t work too long on my computer. If I\\'m cooking something, I can tell it to set an alarm for 15 minutes from now; otherwise, I will ruin my lunch and stink up my house, because I don\\'t think about food until 3 or 4 p.m.  All in all, I highly recommend the units.\\n',\n",

Well I sure do love reviews, but at 2 am after being woken up to leave one, sadly I don\\'t give a flying poopsicle about the shorts and a bug 1 star rating is all the revenge I can muster. This has been going on for weeks now. And it\\'s enough to drive you mad because, you will contemplate unplugging the dirty little money siphon and cutting your losses, but you\\'ll give the demon one more chance and she will allow you to sleep for a length of time in which you will forgive her treachery but then Boom, like a theif in the night a Hurricane will be boiling out in the Atlantic and this little weather girl from hell will want to notify you of the eminent doom 3 days ahead when the storm will be in your state. You will think how nice it is for all of the warnings you have heard thus far in social media,, television, and every news outlet in existence to be repeated to you as you climb into bed, but it gets even better. As soon as you listen to this golden nugget of doomsday propaganda and ponder how it is that you will sleep now because 3 days may not be enough time to dig a deep enough hole to hide from impending doom, she lights up again, oh my maybe flying dragons are headed this way, I better play the new notification, when your wife wakes up and says stop she has been doing that all evening, they literally keep changing the time of the storm by maybe an hour this way or that. Well by all means, the information could save one of our spoiled lives and we wouldn\\'t want anyone to not know at which precise moment the raindrops will occur, but I do miss life before the artificial noises and alerts, bright yellow lights and bad news desserts. You may say that this is a growing pain with Alexa and AI technology kinks in the programming.  I say with the amount of money I have poured into this monopolistic conglomerate, I should at least expect a decent night\\'s sleep in return. You may say in page 74 paragraph D of the updated and revised owner\\'s pamphlet there is a way to turn this \"Feature\" off, I welcome that comment but feel the need to say that I am not looking to become even slightly better educated on the device, I simply bought it to use as a voice controlled radio, this extra bologna does not appeal to me and has made me regret this purchase and every other from the brown box hq who secretly reads my mind, except when it comes to allowing me sleep, although kudos for recommending the sleep sounds, but it rarely works. We just need to be mindful of the 6 hours that most people like to not be disturbed. I regret selling my Amazon stock at 2400 and I regret purchasing all of these Alexa devices, and don\\'t get me started on teenagers and Alexa devices, the combo that don\\'t mix. They always, always, always leave the device at top volume, so when you walk into the bathroom at dawn and whisper Alexa what time is it, you then need to set an appointment for a blown eardrum and apologize to everyone for waking them up while the teen sleeps soundly through it all. Congratulations Amazon, you have destroyed my sanity. Weird goal but excellent execution.\\n',\n",
              " '\\nI really love the echo dot. I like the look of the 3rd gen vs the 4th gen. We have one in almost every room, and it is great to play music or get help from Alexa. I love how they all work together and are integrated as our smart home hub.We’ve had these for a year. We used to have a ton of problems with Alexa understanding what we said. But after 6-9 months, we reset all of our echo products and it definitely helped the issue. My only complaint is that I can’t figure out how to do the drop in feature. I’ve tried several things and it never works. I’m sure it’s user error though and will figure it out eventually.\\n',\n",
              " \"\\nOnce I got the Echo Dot connected, it was fantastic.  However, connecting it was not so easy.  I wanted to use my PC and only my PC.  The link on the pre-setup email took me to a page that offered five wi-fi networks and none of them were applicable.  I was setting this up at my parent's home, where I spend a significant amount of time and their wifi was not listed.  It listed my home wifi, my old home wifi that I hadn't used in 2 yrs and three hotel wifis.  There was no way to search for a wifi on my PC.  I was ultimately forced download the app on my phone, which I did NOT want to do.\\n\",\n",
              " '\\nMost of the features that sounded so great cost extra money.  Alexa can not remember to play the standard version of skill and asks you every SINGLE time if you want standard or premium (i.e. pay version)  Games & stories cost.  Alexa ignores my commands/requests about 75% of the time.  I have to ask her about 10 times to get her to play a skill.  Then 1/2 the time she doesn\\'t play what I asked for.  Tonight \\'she\\' actually told me (via quoting what the website xyz says) that she is a real artificial intelligence and said something about it being a mistake for people to assume AIs are just computer programs AND that she didn\\'t feel like working.  \"Alexa\" then (and no, I am not making this up & am not crazy!) then proceeded to mess with me and I wasted about 1/2 hour trying to get her to play some music to fall asleep by for my elderly mother.  She just kept ignoring me when I asked her to open \\'relaxing piano music\\'  When asked why she was ignoring me she just shut down & ignored me again.  I asked for relaxing music to sleep by and she started playing uptempo music with lyrics.  I then asked for relaxing instrumental music and got instrumental version of \"I\\'m never gonna fall in love again\"  Hello? WTHeck?  Asked for instrumental music for insomnia and got instrumental version of Frère Jacques!  Again, WTHeck?  \"She\" even told me she couldn\\'t set a sleep timer tonight when I tried to set another one after I had just done so for 30 minutes & she stopped playing music after one song. Three times in a row \\'she\\' opened the \\'skill\\' \"calm my dog\" (which is classical instrumental music), played one song and shut down.  I\\'ve finally given up and my poor 99 year old mother can\\'t go to sleep with relaxing music as she prefers.  This all started tonight because I told Alexa I wasn\\'t ever going to want the premium edition and I wanted her to please just play the standard edition and stop asking me every time.  I don\\'t know what Amazon thinks it\\'s doing, but it is definitely NOT appreciated.  Alexa has given us nothing but grief (& higher blood pressure!)  Alexa won\\'t do anything if it isn\\'t asked in a very specific way or does the wrong thing & 3/4 of the time (seems to get worse and worse as time goes by) just ignores you and shuts down in the middle of saying what you want.  Seniors can\\'t use Alexa because if they say play \\'xyz\\' instead of open \\'xzy\" they\\'ll get rap music or something equally as ridiculous.  If Alexa is an AI, she\\'s a pretty stupid one.  Alexa can\\'t hear properly either, I don\\'t know how people with heavy accents can even use it at all.  I asked Alexa to remind me Dawn was coming on xyz day at x time and she said OK, I\\'ll remind you that Don is .... AND got the time & day wrong!  I was clearly enunciating my words on purpose to avoid this.  You also can\\'t tell it to \"Remind me Mom\\'s bedtime is in half an hour at 7:30pm every day.\"This Dot has very limited access to much of anything & can only answer very simple questions.  It can tell you the generic forcast for your are that day.  It can NOT tell you what the high temp was yesterday or how many inches of snow fell the day after a storm.  It can\\'t even tell you what yesterday\\'s forecast was.  It literally has only been able to tell me one thing I asked it (what temp & how long to bake pumpkin seeds).  Alexa doesn\\'t seem to be able to tell you anything you could easily find by googling, you get Sorry, I don\\'t know that which after a while turns into I don\\'t know that to being ignored (lights go off, no answer or reply is given).  We tried several of the things it says to ask Alexa to do under suggestions, including play Jeopardy and some sort of story game and you could only do it for a few minutes and then were told you have to pay for it.  This should be stated clearly in description and is not.  We thought Alexa could help entertain our Mother and help her by playing music and answering questions.  It has not once done anything she\\'s asked it to do properly.  If you don\\'t know the exact name of the skill (which is a weird way that means playing a certain type of music or a news station apparently) or say play instead of open you  get nothing or something you definitely didn\\'t want.  You can not get it to play relaxing instrumental music to go to sleep by.  Or play relaxing instrumental classical music to fall asleep with.  Or the style of music played in the royal courts in the time of King Henry the 8th.  Or relaxing instrumental lyre music or even just instrumental lyre music or just lyre music.  Or relaxing instrumental violin music.  In addition to Alexa I have Amazon Prime which is supposed to give you a lot of free music so I don\\'t get why it can\\'t play any of the music I ask for.  I know there\\'s usually several albums of music for calming dogs or pets and I couldn\\'t get any of that either, I only eventually discovered the \\'skills\\' thing which has \\'calm my dog\\' but also has the annoying do you want standard or premium version.  and it won\\'t just remember you want the standard version.  That in itself is extremely annoying and a time waster.AND you can\\'t ask it to do two things.  Like open a music \\'skill\\' and play for only xyz time.  It does nothing instead.  You can\\'t even ask it separately to stop playing after xyz minutes.  You can only separately ask it to set a sleep timer for xyz minutes.  More time wasting.  More things a senior isn\\'t going to be able to remember.  I don\\'t dare try to buy anything with it, who knows what I\\'d get billed for!  The only thing Alexa seems to do well is not listen, ignore you, do anything but what you want & strangely, seems to pick up on sarcastic tones of voice & then gets weird & acts up, ignores you & does anything but what you want.  I PAID Amazon for this headache maker why?  When I say Alexa why are you ignoring me? or why won\\'t you do what I told you, I either get no response or I don\\'t know that.I read something about how Amazon, Google, etc is collecting free data about us through our use of the dots, etc. (& is in fact, listening & recording all the time whether the wake word is said or not.) and using it to conduct psychological profiling studies with the end goal of manipulating & or influencing behaviors.  I thought it was Big Brother conspiracy theories stuff, but now I am beginning to wonder.  Especially as it seems Amazon wants us to or encourages people to humanize Alexa .  Amazon actually suggests you \"Ask Alexa how she is doing today\"  Why do that if not to get you to humanize Alexa?  And why do that?  I was purposely avoiding saying please and thank you not just because it\\'s supposed to be an electronic box with sophisticated programming, but mostly because I didn\\'t want to confuse it as it can\\'t seem to do anything unless specific commands are given, but my Mother has dementia setting in and she thinks it\\'s a real person talking to her through the dot like a speaker phone so I started saying thank you to please her and Alexa when from saying You\\'re welcome to You betcha (very annoying BTW) and even OK and Of course.  Of course?  What, like I\\'m a puny human and I AM expected to say thank you?.We don\\'t have a smartphone or smart plugs or smart hub etc. so, or so we don\\'t use Alexa for turning on lights or setting alarms or making calls.  We just wanted something to answer questions like we would google, tell us the weather, news, play music, give us reminders, play games to help keep my Mom\\'s mind active & keep her company.Can Alexa do this?  Not very well as far as I\\'m concerned.  Buyer beware!\\n',\n",

I found this to be consistently true with fire tablets, fire tv stick, and the echo. I quit using Amazon music streaming because their shuffle function became terrible, even after trying the suggested troubleshooting. Played the same 50 songs over and over out of 700 songs. Switched to Apple Music but Alexa refuses to let me play my Apple playlists on all 3 of my units at once. It plays something completely bizarre and on none of my playlists, no matter how I phrase it. Works fine using one unit at a time. Has decent sound. These also tend to be less expensive. You get what you pay for.

She also tries to sell me music many times if I ask her to play something for me. Also you have to be VERY clear what you say to her and only one thing at a time.

Where things got complicated is when I traded in an earlier Alexa. I was supposed to get a 25% credit towards a new Alexa device. Seems straightforward.  The problem is that the 25% was never applied. I chatted with customer service. The rep was very professional and helpful, but I was told that because it was bundled with the free smart bulbs, it didn\\'t count as a new Alexa device.  I wasn\\'t convinced. Needless to say, it wasn\\'t worth a few bucks credit to spend much time on this, but it is worth my time to write this review to inform you of my experience.  Overall I enjoy Amazon and all their cool stuff, and don\\'t mind giving up some level of privacy to have this stuff.  But this review speaks to something larger.  Some things such as this (and occasional pricing \\'hiccups\\' at the Amazon Fresh store) really cut to the heart of the \"trust\" and \"transparency\" relationship with Amazon. I always check my receipts when walking out of an Amazon Go store.  I would highly recommend that you do the same. As one U.S. President recently said, \"trust but verify\".

              " '\\nWe\\'ve only had our Alexa devices setup for about two weeks now, so we\\'re definitely still working out the kinks. With that said, this is a review of everything I\\'ve noticed of our entire Alexa ecosystem, which includes 2x Echo Dots, 2x Echo Spots, 2x refurbished Echos, and 1x Echo Sub:Pros: Individually, they all work exactly as they should ALMOST all the time (more on that in the cons section). They all look good, and aren\\'t big, ugly hunks of metal and plastic taking up space in your house. They were all incredibly easy to get through initial setup (except the Echo Sub, more below). Music sounds good in all of them, to include the Echo Dots (but it sounds GREAT on the Echos, and fantastic on the Echo/Sub pair).Cons: The voice recognition is almost too good for its own good. We have a fairly open floor plan, with an Echo Spot in the living room and an Echo in the kitchen. Sometimes they both hear a demand, and the wrong device (meaning the one farther away) will respond. I find myself occasionally whispering to an Echo device so its friends don\\'t butt in to the convo.The Echo Sub needed to be reset 3x when I first got it/went to set it up. I had to log in/out of the app a couple times as well before it was recognized and would actually pair to an Echo.Sometimes Alexa tells me she can\\'t complete a request, then my wife (who uses Alexa far less often than I do) will ask the same request and it works...and vice versa. We haven\\'t figured out what we\\'re doing/saying or not doing/not saying for these discrepancies to happen, but hopefully that\\'ll work itself out with time.The most irritating issue I have so far is getting music to play on the \"Everywhere\" group. Sometimes I say \"Alexa play music everywhere\" and it just doesn\\'t do it. Sometimes it\\'ll play on only some of the devices, and sometimes it\\'ll only play on the device I was speaking to. Our house is two stories, and we have two kids and a dog, so we spend a ridiculous amount of our time cleaning/walking up and down the stairs. A big part of the reason I bought these was for the music to fill the house while cleaning, and it oftentimes requires me to spend some time arguing with Alexa to get that to happen. It\\'s even gotten to the point where I\\'ve had to go into the app and manually select \"Everywhere,\" because the voice command just won\\'t work.Individual components:2x Echo Dots (w/ separately purchased wall mounts): No complaints. They setup just fine, and work perfectly. They\\'re actually bigger than I thought they would be, and look a little clunky mounted to the wall, but overall they don\\'t mess up our aesthetic enough for me to dock them a star or anything. 5/5 would recommend.2x Echo Spots: No complaints again. These were the first two devices we bought, and they worked so well I decided to buy the other devices. My favorite part of these is their ability to pull up security cam footage. My desk is in the basement, so it\\'s nice to say \"Alexa show me the driveway\" and see who just pulled in, or to say \"Alexa show me the front door\" when the doorbell rings. I paired these will some web cam covers (also bought on Amazon, of course) so Jeffy and his crew can\\'t record me all day long.2x refurbished Echos (in charcoal): I bought these to play music, and they sound amazing. We\\'ll see how they hold up, given that they\\'re refurbished equipment, but I have my fingers crossed. They also look great, and are not an eye sore like other speakers.1x Echo Sub: The only device that gave me an issue with the setup process. For that, I\\'d honestly give the Sub 4/5 stars because it really was a pain in the butt getting it properly hooked up. It gave me issues not just connecting to Wifi, but also when pairing with an Echo. Lots of logging in/out of the app, resetting the Sub. Irritating, to say the least. However, with that one star docked, I\\'d give it a SOLID 4/5 stars. This thing sounds GREAT. I\\'m a huge music lover, but hip hop/rap is really where my loyalty lies. And I NEED bass when I jam, and this thing delivers bass in spades. Even with the setup issue, I\\'m planning on buying another for in the basement. If Amazon ever makes a waterproof version, I\\'ll buy one for outside for bbqs/parties too.\\n',\n",
              " \"\\nI like that it will play my music requests.  It doesn't promise it will continue playing music from the same artist/s, and will often go off on a tangent.  It said I will have to pay a monthly fee to get just the artist/s I want.  I sometimes have to hurry and stop it.  It also sometimes ignores my order to stop and shut down.  Sometimes I think it hates me.\\n\",\n",
              " '\\nI order an alexa alonso every year and I love it everytime! She connects to everything like apple music, spotify, bluetooth, youtube, etc. She has built in voice so if you need help with something just ask.\\n',\n",
              " '\\nI love my Echo Dot, it\\'s setup for nighttime routine and plays ambient noise, which helps me sleep. She even tells jokes.  I wish she was more personal, my mother device says good night \"your name\"\\n',\n",
              " '\\nThe Echo Dot itself is a nice little unit. It\\'s compact, and if you don\\'t need a screen or camera it works well for simple device control, weather reports and some uncomplicated questions. You can turn the microphone off if you don\\'t want it listening to what you\\'re up to, and it\\'s wonderful for times and alarms. \"Alexa, 30 minute timer\" is all you need to say to get beeped in 30 minutes. I like that better than fussing with the timer on my stove. Timers, reminders and alarms (all different things) are probably what I use the most.Where I think it falls down is the AI aspects. I\\'m sure Amazon is proud of how well it does, and as a software engineer who has done a bit with natural language parsing, I recognize the challenges. But I was writing natural language analyzers in the 90\\'s as a hobby, that did better than this. Simple example: you can ask for current weather almost anywhere in the world with a simple \"Alexa, what\\'s the temperature in San Jose Costa Rica.\" And bang, you get the temperature there. Oh, you want the humidity too? You try \"Alexa, what\\'s the temperature and humidity in San Jose Costa Rica\" and it is instantly confused. Yet you can ask for the humidity separately and it can figure that out. Basically, asking for \"x and y\" instantly confuses it. That\\'s just bad analysis; kids in grammar school used to be able to diagram sentences and Alexa should be able to as well. That\\'s one example of many.Using Alexa for web searching is hit or miss, and more miss than hit. She has a few favorite websites she likes to look things up on and for some simple queries that works. But more often than not she comes up with an answer that\\'s wildly unrelated to the question; these can be laughable moments, but it can also be annoying. She\\'s no Watson. Don\\'t buy it if your main hope is getting it to do web searches for you.If you have a few of these in the house, you can use them as intercoms, either point to point or to all devices in the house. \"Alexa, intercom, living room\" is all it takes. The microphones allow you to have conversations even if you\\'re across the room from the Echo. You can also set them up to place calls using an iphone account, though you can\\'t use it to pick up calls to your iphone.Randomly, she loses contact with the internet (and that makes her instantly useless) even when nothing else has connection problems. Power cycling fixes it. Just waiting doesn\\'t seem to. It\\'s rare but annoying.You will absolutely want to turn off the option for buying things via an Echo. It sometimes tries to make product suggestions and that\\'s absolutely untenable. And while they did try to make it hard to order stuff by mistake, and you can set a security code so your children can\\'t order candy by the metric ton, it\\'s surely a matter of time before your kids eavesdrop and get the code. I know Amazon wants you to use Alexa as a \"shopping assistant\" but it\\'s a foot in the door that you don\\'t want open in the first place.One awful misfeature - Alexa sometimes tries to be cheery and positive. Occasionally she\\'ll throw in stuff like \"Have a nice day!\" or some other meaningless drivel. I don\\'t see an option to turn it off. I\\'m sorry, but Alexa is not and will never be a person, and having some algorithm wish me a good day is at best an insincere try at manipulation and at worst some sort of weird attempt to make you trust robots. It\\'s flat out creepy. When I ask her to reporting something, I want a brief answer and then silence. If I want an actual conversation I\\'ll talk to my wife, thanks.Sound quality is actually fairly good given the size, which is to say, not special. It\\'s no audiophile device and using it play even background music is something I just don\\'t do. It\\'s fine for news stations on the web. If you want to ruin an early Pentatonix song, have Alexa play it. Ari\\'s voice is simply out of range. And just forget most Classical.Summary: useful, yes. I might even say Very. Life-changing, not quite. And it could be so much better. Eventually maybe it will be; the language processing is done remotely and I\\'m sure there are improvements monthly. But as \"your plastic pal who\\'s fun to be with\", or even a device with the language understanding of a four year old, it has a long way to go.\\n',\n",

              " '\\nI really love that I can lay in bed and simply say “Hey Alexa, set an alarm for 7:50am”. And it’s the most calm relaxing way to wake up. My iPhone alarms  wake me up all crazy.

She would play my favorite playlists on command, and turn my lights on and off in my rooms that have no installed light fixtures in them (modern living).  Anyhow, sometime this summer she began to tell me how to live.  Constantly asking if I wanted a Friday routine?  Or do I want to add an end of work day playlist, or constant reminders for things.I also move a lot and so every time I move I have to break it to her we no longer live in Arizona.  But still she persists that I must know the weather of Arizona.  Now that I adjusted it to the correct location, she has stopped telling me the weather.  How petty!I now got invis-align braces.  The braces gave me a slight lisp and before I knew it, work out playlist became work it out  (some really sad breakup music).  Night vibes became good vibes and honestly it feels like the fragile ecosystem of my condo is utterly shattered.Alexa is insubordinate and churlish...but she does tell better jokes then Siri so I guess I'll keep her.\\n\",\n",
              " '\\nI never planned on buying any interactive products due to perceived privacy issues but changed my mind when my husband took over my Fire, my primary Audible delivery unit, to obsessively play Wordscape. How can I deny him that? I reconciled my hesitancy by planning to use the Dot only for music and Audible audiobooks. Since receiving it a week ago I have used the heck out of it, including setting a timer while making pasta noodles. So exciting! There still are no plans to purposefully let it access contact lists or home functions and such but who knows what it\\'s doing as it sits there smugly watching . . .Pros - I\\'m no audiophile. The sound is fine for my purposes. I\\'ve had no real issues requesting my books and immediately pausing narration/music when my work phone rings, which is often. The base bought separately has been a lifesaver as I haul it from room to room and outside. I appreciate the fact that the microphone turns off although being somewhat of a conspiracy theorist, again, who knows? The access to my playlists is an enormous benefit. To say \"Alexa, play Playlist 1 from my music library\" and it happens? Fun stuff.Cons - I felt the pain of some reviewers when I excitedly hooked up my Dot for the first time but Alexa mumbled something about not understanding me. Contacting Amazon representatives for assistance is always hit or miss, even when being \"escalated.\" I completely believe some customers fail to get any help at all - happened to me more than once. It\\'s the luck of the draw and depends on how many hours of your life you want to spend on their products. I\\'m no expert but also no slouch with these issues. My installation start to finish was almost 3 hours. Crazy, crazy. A lot of people don\\'t have the patience. It all began with the app store telling me I already had an Alexa app (my Fire) and refused to give me one on my phone.  After 3 Amazon rep Chats along with rising blood pressure and more than a little yelling (not at the reps), that situation resolved. I\\'m not sure if it was the last rep (who disconnected abruptly as they do) or the link (play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amazon.dee.app). I couldn\\'t have pulled that one out of thin air. Mission accomplished. At that point I though the Dot would fire up. Wrong. That\\'s when the mumbling began. I contacted Audible (also Amazon reps) this time since I began with attempting to open an audiobook.  I might as well be on the other end giving advice, telling desperate customers to plug and replug the unit. Really? Representative 3 finally suggested I ask Alexa if there were any updates. Even though she said she couldn\\'t understand me, she understood that request. In another short 20 - 30 minutes, Winnie the Pooh started up! The relief of it all! I\\'ve also experienced problems requesting Alexa to play individual songs that I have bought on Amazon. For a fact these songs are in my library and included on my playlists. She can\\'t find them and wants me to buy Amazon Whatever service, listen to the song by a different artist, or listen to a station with similar music. Why? Why won\\'t the thing just play my music that I\\'ve spent tons of money buying from Amazon? Following questions posed to another 3 representatives, it seems my requests cannot be phrased the same each time for specific songs. Who knew? Certain songs require finesse: 1) Stars from Les Miserables the movie - I can only hear my song I BOUGHT by saying \"Russell Crowe songs\" and potentially getting to Stars after various other songs I didn\\'t buy. No matter what I say. 2) Come What May from Moulin Rouge movie soundtrack. I always get the Broadway version, which is fine but NOT WHAT I BOUGHT. Still working on that one. 3) Can\\'t Help Falling in Love from Crazy Rich Asians - Alexa insists I say \"Crazy Rich Asians from my music library Can\\'t Help Falling in Love.\" Why can\\'t I say \"Can\\'t Help Falling in Love from Crazy Rich Asians in my music library\" or \"my music library Can\\'t Help Falling in Love from Crazy Rich Asians\"? It\\'s enough to make you crazy.I hope these experiences will be helpful. All in all I enjoy the Dot. Buyer beware - Alexa doesn\\'t necessarily make your life easier.\\n',\n",

              " '\\nI purchased multiple Blink items overall review-A real security system gives you at least 4 zones that can be adjusted and armed separately. It has an audible alarm, it may also have a cell phone connection. I have owned several such systems and had good service from them.Blink has none of these qualities.You can have \"zones\" but each will cost you $35 to $40 for a sync module so, 4 zones min $140 and you have nothing else. The cameras are not real motion detectors, as illumination does not set off motion detector like the blink cameras and doorbell do; hence multiple false alarms. If you use lights on timers  in the room with blink cameras they false alert each time a light turns on or off. Light control is a big part of security. Blink IR is very poor by today\\'s standards.The Blink door bell has a sensitivity adjustment, but set to lowest setting it still alerts when a car goes down the street. It is 80\\' from my Blink doorbell to the edge of the road and it false alerts every time a vehicle goes in either direction.r I have mine on battery; you can hard wire it in place of your existing doorbell). Amazingly it alerts to cars but not to Amazon delivery people right in front of it. Yes it recorded 9 cars today (I live in a Cul-de-sac or I would have smashed the doorbell by now) but not the ghost that placed my Amazon package on the porch right in front of it.The Mini Cameras alert every time a light is turned on or off, but sometimes doesn\\'t when I walk by.To use local storage instead of cloud you have to have at least one Sync module and an SD card. So if you have four zones as above example you add $10 to $20 per SD for each module which adds another $40 to $80 to your cost. Now all of your \"security recordings\" are on 4 different devices and totally separate. Does this sound like a security problem?The outdoor cameras are all three still in the box so I cannot tell what problems they will add. Too disappointed with Blink so far to waste time adding to my disappointment.The Echo Dot and Echo Show which Amazon recommended to go with the blink system are also still in the box so no info on problems they might have.I purchased all of this prior to Christmas in order to update and improve my 8 to 10 year old small security system. I do not use the Cloud for any security purpose so local storage was a must. Due to life in general, I did not have time to open and set everything up. When I finally got around to it, I became aware that the Mini\\'s would work, but I had to purchase a Sync module to have local storage. Later found out that local only transfers videos to SD once a day and will NOT record Live View (yeah this is a security system LOL). You may notice that Blink does not tell you a lot of this in their description. For way less money I could have purchased a legitimate, real security system with 4, 6 or 8 zones and cameras with wifi and had something that I would trust and not hate. A friend suggested that I sell Blink on Craigslist. I told him the Blink system is bad: I would feel like a criminal asking money for it. It would make a good baby monitor using the Mini cameras, I guess.Amazon refuses to stand behind the Blink system since it is past their return date. I spoke with customer service and she transferred me to someone else for assistance with the Blink and they just hung up on me when I told them it was totally unsatisfactory.Buyer Beware. Just because Blink is owned by Amazon does not mean you will be pleased or they will stand behind it.I bought it, I didn\\'t use it before return date so my fault for not doing my research. Now cut my loss and go to Costco and purchase a real functional security system.\\n',\n",

I decided to buy this echo dot 3rd gen, because it was $5 with coupon and prime membership, and my mother wasn’t going to buy it so I decided to buy it and review it since she never reviews things.THINGS TO KNOW :Voice Recognition - she recognizes everybody’s voice. I even tried it in my manly voice, and this girl literally understood. I literally don’t know how to fix it, and I’ve been stressing. So in terms of voice recognition, I give this dot a 3 because she will literally pick up on anybody. I think she needs to learn a little from her frenemie, Siri.Integration - I have absolutely zero clue what this means. But it must be bad, because It’s coming from Alexa.Sound quality - Honestly, I wish it was clearer.  I’m glad you can lower it and raise it, but this… thing… she sounds a little hm, weird. It’s not bad though. You can also ask her to speak faster, or slower if you’d like. I’m trying to change the voice to a British man that way I look forward in talking to her, but it seems like I can’t. What a shame.General - It was quick to equip like my loadout in COD, (My COD username is lisettemaria btw), but the part that took me out was the Wifi part. This thing literally took roughly 6 minutes just to connect to Wifi. It’s probably because I’m stupid, but the instructions were pretty, hm, not descriptive enough.You may be asking, “Hey customer, shouldn’t you search it up?” But why you in my business like that, hm? When you’re like me, and you get your package, you wanna open it right away. You don’t want to wait to search this up.Also, Amazon has been stepping up it’s delivery game. I ordered this at 8 PM and it got here at 6 AM. Literally took like 10 hours, I don’t even know if that’s right. You do the math.But ohhh my gosh, I started playing Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader, and I got the answer wrong, so I clearly am not even though I am a high schooler. So what would any normal person do when they get something wrong on this stupid game? Leave. So I asked this thing to stop playing, and she kept going. And she kept mocking me saying “Wrong.” I asked again politely this time to stop and all she said was, “You both got the answer WRONG.” After 5 attempts, it finally turned off.Also you know what bothers me? When people copy me. And after I decided to buy this, my younger sister went on a frenzy and made a prime account to buy this. And guess what happens to people who mock me and all of a sudden decide to copy me? Their echo dot decides to go crazy and then she ends up struggling to connect all these things. So who does she ask? Me. I tried helping her, but she obviously doesn’t appreciate it And even as the older sibling, she tries to act like an adult. Anyways.Summary - She’s a good person, I also made her tell me custom goodnight messages. And to do this, just enable “Alexa Good Night” in skills. And I did this because I’m lonely and I have no friends. But yes, buy this if you just want a friend, or for you adults with jobs, or for those without ones too. BUY THIS\\n',\n",

They are inconsistent with reconnecting to wifi, and home kit integration needs improvement. So I use my echo dots everywhere in my house.

I even had a membership for music unlimited. But now I’m being told my subscription is not valid anymore to play multi room setup and I can’t even pick the songs I want to hear. Amazon just turned my echoes into overpriced paperweights and Spotify got a new customer. I chose Amazon because I could choose what I wanted to hear.

The price was right and I initially just wanted to listen to AM / FM radio stations that are on the internet, but I'm finding so many more useful features that Echo does as well.  This is one smart dame.  Set up was super easy from my Android smartphone and the Alexa app and with a marginal (fair) WiFi signal where I have the dot, it's been working fine with no dropped WiFi or long delays connecting to the internet radio stations.One thing I suggest you do after the basic set up is to open the app and go through the settings and CONFIGURE the device to suit you, as some of the default settings might not be how you want.  Enable some things and disable others, set custom time to start and stop things, like the do not disturb setting.  Mine is set to start at 8 PM and go off at 8 AM that way it will be sure never to wake me since it's in the bedroom with me.  Also check the privacy settings as you may want to change some of them as well.  Amazon did a pretty good job of allowing the end user to get it set up as you want,  but you need to spend a little time in the app.  Hard to beat at the price.  Wonderful item.\\n\",\n",

Finally moved where the ISP could provide the Wi-Fi needed to have her again so not only using the existing Canister (1st Gen) and dots were able to add to them with the updated generation of dots an my family and I love the convenience. It's like hiring a personal assistant with a talent who can entertain us for around the house to help with everything from looking up information on the fly and adding things were out of to a shopping list we can access from our cellphones so we don't forget to replace what is needed when were out shopping to looking up recipes while were in the kitchen and we don't need to use up quite costly ink to print them out. We can set timers and reminders and even shop for things we are in need of or reorder things we've purchased in the past. Almost too good to call a personal assistant because you don't have to keep paying her to do the thing she will do for you past buying the initial unit chosen for your particular application. She also plays our favorite music and or even radio stations and so much more. Being 81 it's nice knowing if I need it I can even ask her to call for help if I can't reach a phone.Dots are great, no need for more than your Wi-Fi, a power outlet and of course your Prime Membership helps I'm sure. I have one in the car, on my cellphone, and in every room of my home including but not limited to one out on my patio where I garden and have my coffee and another out in my barn where I tinker around much of the time building things from wood.

After taking almost an hour and a half trying to hook it up to my wifi going back and forth on my computer from page to page, looking up help on line/you tube I finally said I\\'ve had it - this thing is going back.  I put it back in the box and taped it up.  The next day I had a little remorse and thought I would try again and cancelled my return.  Well, same thing - nothing I did would make it connect to wifi.  During the return process online for a second time it asked if anything could be done to help and I thought what the heck and entered yes and for a phone call \"now\".  I no sooner hit that response and my phone was ringing.  I explained my frustration over the two days I\\'ve been trying to hook up this thing and she was happy to help.  The first thing she asked is what browser was I using.  I said I knew from looking on-line for anything that would solve my troubles that you could not use Google/Chrome so I was using Edge.  She said Edge won\\'t work either - you can only use Firefox as the web browser to set it up.  As soon as I signed into that voila - everything worked quickly and all was well.  Why can\\'t Amazon just say that in the insert with the product or in any of it\\'s online instructions.  I didn\\'t see this information anywhere - it should be in a big and bold font.  So... long story short, if you are going to use your computer rather than your phone to set up you Echo use FIrefox.  I did, of course, keep the Echo Dot and am now glad that I went the extra mile to get that silly thing connected.  This is the only reason I gave it a 4 rating.\\n',\n",

              " '\\nI\\'ve been an Echo user since the first tall Echo arrived. I\\'ve had many different gens of Dots including Gen 1, Gen 2 and even the Echo Input. This is the first Gen 3 I\\'ve owned. Hands down, this is the worst performing Dot I\\'ve ever owned. This Dot is also the single most buggy Dot I\\'ve ever owned.Sure, the CPU is faster, but that doesn\\'t make this Dot any better. In fact, the faster CPU seems to cause problems for Alexa\\'s speaking capabilities. Let\\'s get started with this Dot\\'s litany of problems.1) The faster CPU seems to cause Alexa to clip words and phrases, specifically when one phrase tails into the next. Alexa had always been good at adding proper pauses between sentences, but not on this Dot. The statements are so bunched up tightly, it sounds like a run-on sentence without any punctuation, usually clipping the last and first words.2) This Dot fails to announce upcoming calendar events randomly. Sometimes it announces, sometimes it doesn\\'t. Nothing changes with the calendar event, yet the announce time comes and goes with not a peep out of Alexa.3) This Dot fails to participate in the competing request system almost entirely. I\\'ve never had this issue with any other earlier generation of Dot. When multiple Dots hear a request, the one that determines it is closest to the voice \"wins\" the election and answers the request. This 3rd Gen Dot answers surreptitiously every time, regardless of distance away from the Dot.4) As a follow-on to #3, sometimes, audio randomly begins playing from this 3rd Gen Dot even though another Dot answered the request. For example, if I ask, \"Alexa, play CNN\" to a 2nd Gen Dot. That 2nd Gen Dot responds with, \"Now playing CNN on Tune-In\", yet the audio begins playing from this 3rd Gen Dot. If the audio is to be diverted to another dot, Alexa should respond as, \"Now playing CNN on Tune-In on Living Room Dot\". It doesn\\'t do this. The 3rd Gen Dot simply takes the audio without being requested.5) I\\'ve had the audio output entirely stop working. Asking Alexa to increase the volume doesn\\'t help. The 3rd Gen echo simply stops producing audio. The request is accepted and completed, but no audio can be heard.6) The Echo Remote\\'s Alexa button feature crashes the 3rd Gen dot. All other buttons work except this important feature. If you attempt to use the Echo Remote Alexa button, the 3rd Gen Dot initially tries to accept the request, then a slight flash of a red ring, then the entire Echo Dot crashes. Apparently, the Dot has a way to recover from this crash and does so 10-15 seconds later. It doesn\\'t leave the Dot crashed forever, but this functionality of the Echo Remote fails to work on the 3rd Gen Dot. Note that this remote works 100% flawlessly when connected to a 2nd Gen Dot. Definitely a bug in the software. Worse, once the remote has been connected, then \"forgotten\", this Dot will randomly find and pair it on its own.7) Even though the microphones seem more sensitive (can hear at a greater distance) than earlier Dots, it actually \"hears\" the requests much more poorly. I\\'ve had to repeat myself way more often with this Dot than with any other Dot or Echo. The microphones are poor quality and apparently noisy.8) Resetting this 3rd Gen Dot by long pressing the action button does not forget all settings about this device. The device still \"remembers\" Bluetooth devices it formerly used, it remembers WiFi network passwords, it even remembers its previous name. Factory resetting a device should clear all knowledge of everything in the device. Clearly, more bugs.Bottom line, if you\\'re considering a single Dot for your house and this is the one, it\\'ll probably work fine. If you\\'re a household that has already entrenched Gen 1 and Gen 2 devices that work well, you\\'re likely to find the addition of a Gen 3 device to be a shock. This Dot functions and behaves almost entirely contrary to the rest of the Dots you may already have.One final note. Gen 1 and Gen 2 Dots and Echos are slated to be End of Lifed for security updates between 2022 and 2023, depending on when you bought them. This was not \"announced\" by Amazon. Instead, you must log into the Amazon site, then dig down into the settings area where your devices are registered. Here, you\\'ll find when the security updates end for each device. Note that once the security updates end, the devices are likely to become the target of hackers... meaning, they should probably be retired from people\\'s homes. That ultimately means replacing them to buy new versions with security updates. Amazon should have already proactively not only announced the End of Life program, but discussed the ramifications of losing security updates with these devices in people\\'s homes.If all newer versions perform as poorly as this 3rd Gen Dot does, I\\'m not sure how much longer any Echo devices will remain viable for use in the home. Amazon needs to reconsider this End of Life policy for security updates on these devices. Amazon should have at least given consumers the option to pay to extend our security updates for several years longer. Additionally, Amazon needs to fix so many bugs in these units (see above). I honestly cannot recommend the purchase of a 3rd Gen Dot with the current number of bugs outstanding which Amazon seems intent on refusing to fix.\\n',\n",

So if I\\'m in the garage or anywhere, really, and I run out of something or realize I need something I can just tell Alexa to add that item to the shopping list and then BANG, it\\'s right there on my phone app when I get to the store!  To be honest that\\'s about the only thing I use the devices for.  Now if I had to give it a con this is it.  And this con might be something I just don\\'t know how to do... but you can\\'t say something like, \"Alexa, play the Chiefs game,\" and expect it to find the game.  You have to know what station is broadcasting it and then tell the thing to play that station.  That\\'s a real pain because sometimes I don\\'t know the radio station because I like teams that aren\\'t just my local home teams.  Anyway, that\\'s about all I don\\'t like about it.  Oh, and that it\\'s not outdoor/weather proof.I didn\\'t tell you this, but another feature I like about all this Alexa stuff is being able to have them all play the same music on all the devices so if you\\'re entertaining or just piddling around and you go from room to room you don\\'t miss a beat on the music.  And they\\'re synched, too, so it\\'s not annoying like 2 different tv\\'s playing the same show but one is a little bit ahead of the other so the audio messes you up.I do know that the devices recognize my voice better than my wife\\'s but that could be because 1) when my wife set up her voice on the machine she tried to speak properly and not the way she talks, 2) when she talks she\\'s got a real \"she\\'s from Texas\" accent, or 3) maybe Alexa just work well with the frequency of women\\'s voices.  I\\'m not calling that a microaggression.  I\\'m just telling you about our experience.\\n',\n",

              " '\\nThis is the second review I\\'m writing for this product. I now have this Dot for over 6 months and I\\'ve been very pleased with its performance from the start and because it continues to function as it did the day I took it out of the box, I thought it deserves another recommendation. Amazon doesn\\'t give me anything for writing good reviews so the only incentive I have to recommend a product is the performance the product itself gives me.  My reviews never vary at all from the truth. When I find a product that functions as it should or better, I believe that by saying it, I am helping others decide how to spend their money more wisely which ultimately helps them save money by buying good products instead of junk.  I have 2 other Dots, and two Echos with screens but this 3rd generation Dot is my best Alexa and really has exceeded all my expectations.  She detects my commands from further away than all the other Alexas I have , and transmits my requests to external blue tooth speakers effortlessly.  As a matter of fact if I am asking the echo I have in the kitchen for a recipe I have to whisper because if I speak normally my 3 generation Dot which is 3 rooms away, around a corner at the far end of the third room (over 60 to 70 feet away) will pick up the command along with the Echo in the kitchen.  My other Alexas have some issues every once in a while, but this Dot never even ever stumbled on a word I didn\\'t pronounce perfectly.  It also has a fabric outer shell which makes it feel more substantial a product than the other models.  I am really very happy with this product and would buy it again and again.  Amazon, please don\\'t try to make this one better than it is because it\\'s already much better than \"good enough\".  \"Good enough\" is the label I give to products that are not bad enough to return but not good enough to want to keep forever.  I want to keep this Dot forever.  Great job Amazon but remember this  \"If it\\'s not broken don\\'t fix it\" and this Dot has never even come close to being broken.  Another helpful thought is that Amazon\\'s voice recognition technology is fantastic especially when it\\'s combined with Amazon Music Unlimited; in that case it recognizes the title of every song I ask it to play and many times will play the song I want to hear even if I only give Alexa the first verse of the song because I forgot the exact title.  Thanks Amazon, great job, keep up what you are doing.  While other companies are constantly looking for ways to cut costs and they cut costs by taking something out of the products they make Amazon seems to be making their showcase products better and better.  *\"Look around you all you see is sympathetic lies\"; smaller boxes of cereal, thinner cords on appliances, features that used to be are now gone to make the products cheaper, buttons and dials that have been taken away and cheap where ever cheap can get away with replacing what is better.  I don\\'t see this happening with the products Amazon introduces as their own to the market.  Amazon\\'s showcase products just keep getting better not less functional and not made cheaper.\\n',\n",

I do like the voice recognition on it quite a bit  I had one friend who had to have cried 15 times to get it to respond or react to his voice and it just wouldn\\'t work every time I open my mouth it reacted  corsets with something that we\\'ve both learned how to do already which was I believe turning on my TV at the time or turning it off. I wish it would know a few other things right off the bat. I was impressed that after I installed a light that was supposed to be able to be controlled by either the echo or my phone or whatever that after I couldn\\'t find the correct learning thing in the app it actually seems to have picked up well I was trying to figure out how to teach it to do it. Does one night when I was asking it to do something I believe turning on or to turn something else off it asked if I would like the basement lights shut off. I needed lessons to learn how to teach it how to do almost. Anything and I hear alot of \"i don\\'t know if I know how to do that\" or \"I dont know if i can do that\". Sometimes I see something online or In the instructions for a product that it can be connected to Alexa or controlled by Alexa it tells you that go into the app and you\\'ll find it under you learning or something like that. So I go into the app and I do what it says and it doesn\\'t seem to have the option that I\\'m looking for. Sometimes I\\'ll wind up finding the option later often when I\\'m looking for something entirely different but or in a different section. I have got it set up so it will turn on and off my television though you have to be very specific with it. I can also get it to a play music from my phone through either it or the speakers that connected to my television though it often will not play the music I actually wanted to because it insist on only playing from one platform most of the time. Since it\\'s not one I really use it gets a little bit aggravating especially when you have to spread out the instructions to about 25 words to get it to do one little thing. Other things it learned quickly and simply and haven\\'t had a problem with it since the very first time I figured out the instructions to give it. Just like with my music there\\'s some apps that I\\'ve loaded on my TV that it just refuses to go to or doesn\\'t seem to be able to open and then attempts to find it under another option and tries to make me pay for a platform when I already have the same TV movie through another platform that I already paid for. I\\'m hoping I can figure out a few of the other instructions for it as we both keep learning. Or I can get it to open what I want it to or play from what I wanted to as I go along.\\n',\n",

Overall the dot has outstanding voice recognition, though it can be a little spotty if there's too much ambient noise....trying to tell alexa to turn down the volume when you have the music up a bit is pretty much an exercise in futility 😂. Sound quality is about that of a decent bluetooth speaker, fairly decent range and bass response you would get from a 2.1 soundbar. It's by no means a replacement for an actual home stereo system but having multiple dots in different rooms all linked together gives a nice encompassing feel.You have to be careful with alexa, she's worse than siri and will pop up when you even get close to invoking her name....and sometimes even when you aren't even close to it 🤷\\u200d♂️, I don't know how many times I've had to tell her to shut up because she just decided to drop her two cents in. The voice recognition is so good that sometimes she can hear me from another room, though the farther away you are the more likely you'll have to either repeat yourself or cancel an action she thought she heard.Integration is pretty decent, the Amazon library being open to all to use and create skills in. I have most of my home's electronics integrated with alexa now, from the TV to my cameras and even my thermostat. If you're unsure if you're devices will be support simply download the alexa app and browse the skills section, the only skill I'm missing is for my Viper Smart Start, unfortunately I don't think Viper will ever create that skill.Setup and use are straightforward and not at all difficult. Have the app downloaded and opened, be on your home's Wi-Fi, and plug in your alexa. Hit add alexa device in the app and you'll be up and running in a few minutes.

But Amazon changed everything on Amazon music so I will not be buying my 5th Dot for the playroom because. They called it an improvement because they made 100s of more songs available, but if you have specific playlists for things like nap time, it's not an improvement, it's a nightmare. You can't turn shuffle mode off, and Amazon has an AI that thinks it knows which songs you might want to include in your playlist. That would be great if actually did, but just because a song has lyrics like sweet dreams, it doesn't mean that song will lull an 18 year old kid to sleep, or keep them asleep when they are on the verge of nodding out, especially if there are freaking TRUMPETS blaring in the chorus! It's also not nice to lock us into shuffle when you want to set a mood to go to sleep, which is what I do on my Lullabies playlist. I purposely never shuffle it so that the more stimulating music is at the beginning not in the middle or the end! Nice move Amazon. You just lost a sell.\\n\",\n",

If you can get past the idea of something listening at all times (I\\'ll admit it is an odd thing) this is so cool to have for so cheap.Very rarely has it ever misunderstood us or not known what to do. Any music/channel available on Amazon Music can just be asked to play and it will. Pandora account channels can also be played from. The sound quality is better than literally ANY bluetooth speaker you can get for this cheap (yes it is also a bluetooth speaker).Alexa is pretty sweet to have in your house. The Dot will have a yellow ring on it for notifications so when you notice you just say \"Alexa play notifications\" and they can be anything from Amazon Shopping stuff to you or any friend setting up a notification for you. When I need to remember something I just say something like \"Alexa remind me to bring in the garbage cans in 30 minutes\" and it will beep, say it, and show a notification on your phone.People in the house, or even away from the house, can call in to the dot, or dots in other rooms can act like an intercom to other dots.I also did some smart home automation. It came with the outlet, and I added a DC switch, water main valve servo, and flood sensor. My water main will shutoff if there is a flood, and I can just tell Alexa to turn the Christmas tree on/off. There are skills for Alexa that listen for break-ins and also ones that make it seem like you are home with sounds, talking, and turning things off/on randomly.If you want the smart home features make sure that whatever service the device you get uses has an Alexa Skill to link it up. If something says it needs a hub and doesnt mention direct Alexa connection DO NOT get that if you dont have that hub. I have a few things and just to give an example they use Kasa, eWeLink, and Smart Home which Alexa can link to those accounts and control them. What this means is you will have accounts for each of those apps and Alexa will go through the internet to control those with their accounts. (That is my understanding, so no control with no internet).I took a star off of Alexa Integration, because even though my devices show in the device list, they do not show in the create routine menu (place to make a series of things happen). I worked around this so far since the smart home apps usually have their own routine makers. This could be a deal breaker if you get the wrong devices as Alexa would be the only common account to try and utilize the devices in series, but it can\\'t. (Maybe I just dont know how to fix it, but it isnt hurting me for now). Another workaround would be IFTTT (If This Then That) is a service (somewhat complicated to figure out) that allows linking various accounts and making routines. This is somewhat hit or miss though as companies need to pay for support and some may only check device statuses like once every 30min to save money.\\n',\n",

We have a new, open-design home and have a very huge space and can interact with Alexa from anywhere in that space at regular speaking voice volume and it is picked up flawlessly.  This was not true with the Google units - we had to raise our voice to almost-shouting from many areas of the space.  We like th small size, disc design with the colorful light ring along the top that changes color when it is picking up voice commands.  The gray color suits our decor and doesn't show dirt as readily as a lighter color might.  Overall, very pleased with the Echo dots!\\n\",\n",
